# RPG Series Project (Side B)
Hey guys, I'm Ozer! This repository contains the project files for our implementations on the challenges from HMIF ITB GameDev Community RPG tutorial series, where we learn several concepts in Unity by making a basic 2D RPG game. Unfortunately, this tutorial is closed to the public, but you are welcome to check out what we made.

If you want to check out the main tutorial project, check out the `side-a` branch.

This repo is going to be updated through out the tutorial series. Although this project documents updates that happen on each episode, playing a scene prior to the latest episode might not work as expected. That said, you are welcome to download and make any modifications to the project. Assets used in this project is licensed under CC0, unless stated otherwise.
